# ai-project



This is the project of Yanfang GUO and Jin LI.

The file strcututes:

1. the implementation of algorithms
   - AI_id3.py
   - AI_kmeans.py
   - AI_Knn.py
   - naive_bayes.py
   - naive_bayes_conti.py
2. the test script: you only need to click run, then you can test the algorithms
   - main_kmeans.py
   - main_knn.py
   - main_naive_bayes.py
   - main_id3.py
3. other files
   - toolkit.py: this is the collections of the additional function we write
   - validation.py: this is the script we use to compare the algorithms, if you want to run the file, you need to uncomment the code.
